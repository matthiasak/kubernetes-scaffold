# kubernetes-scaffold

A general setup Makefile and resources for a live-reload workflow which holds some general targets and setups for configuring a k8s cluster.

## Setup a cluster on Mac or Windows

Run the default target `make` to install the default cluster setup.

## Support

Currently, I only have scripts for setting up clusters on Mac and Linux. PRs welcomed for "Docker for Windows" and minikube setups.
